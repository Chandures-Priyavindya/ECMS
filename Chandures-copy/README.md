# ECMS
This system monitors and optimizes energy consumption in industrial facilities. It tracks energy  usage across machines, identifies inefficiencies, and suggests improvements. The AI component  uses a clustering algorithm to group machines by energy usage patterns, helping identify outliers  for optimization.
